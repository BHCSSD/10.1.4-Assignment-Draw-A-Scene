# 10.1.4-Assignment Draw a scence 
Graded
# P5 Assign 1 Draw a Scene

## Marking
- 80% - drawing the scene with the requirements below
- 15% - proper indenting is maintained (Tidy your Code and fix your indenting).
  - proper commenting is included, end of function comments: "} // end draw", what each part of your code does aka //snowman head, //bat body etc
- 5% - 1 moving item using a variable and if() statement. Look at 10.1.3 adding text for how to do that.  

## Set Up
1. Create a canvas that is 700 x 700 with a background of your choice
2. Then in `draw()`, add 3 lines of text at the top of the window
  - it doesn't matter what your 3 lines of text say, it just needs to be there.       


## Main Task
Your goal is to draw something of your own choice, -or- one of the following things/scenes.  
1. a house on a street
2. an old school iPod
3. a car or truck or submarine
4. a snowman
5. a Minecraft Creeper
6. Stanley Cup or other trophy
7. For a tougher challenge, try a colorful Canadian Flag
8. Any other scene that you can think of

## Your drawing must include:
- A background colour
- At least **10 shapes**, including all of the following:
  - Lines
  - Rectangles -or- squared
  - Ellipses -or- circles
  - Optional shapes: triangles, quad, arc
  - some shapes must be filled, using multiple colours
  - You could also use random(255) to affect your color codes.
  - multiple stroke thicknesses of lines. Example:  `strokeWeight(5);`
  - 3 lines of text somewhere on your drawing

## Tips
- It is sometimes easier to draw with:  `rectMode(CENTER);`
- Then if you want to go back to normal rectangle mode:	`rectMode(CORNER);`
- Consider using `noFill()`  & `noStroke()`

## Done early?  
- Practice adding a Font and give your artwork a title.
- Try animating your picture.  Can you make your snowman wave by moving your mouse? Or add a bird that flies across your screen.
- If you already know how to add images, or figure out how to include a picture as a background.  For example, you could have a winter scene picture behind your snowman.  To do this you do NOT use the background( ) code, you just put the right-sized image at 0,0.  Example: `image(snowscenePic, 0, 0, 400, 600);`

function setup() {
createCanvas(300, 400);


  rectMode(CENTER);
}//end setup

function draw() {
  background(179, 89, 0);
  fill(221, 153, 255);
  rect(150, 30, 120, 80, 10);
  
  //at least 10 shapes
  //fill, stroke, strokeWeight
  //triangle, quad or point (Help... reference)
  // 3 lines of text
  
}//end draw

function mousePressed(){
  print(mouseX + ",   " + mouseY);
}//end mousePressed

```
